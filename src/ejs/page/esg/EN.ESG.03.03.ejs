                                            We are steadfast in our commitment to proactively mitigate serious accident risks and cultivate a safe and health work environment. This entails identifying safety hazards at worksites through risk assessment, developing and implementing recommended actions, and verifying their effectiveness. Since 2022, we have conducted risk assessments twice a year, ensuring that all 93 safety hazards identified in 2023 (with a risk level of 6 or higher) have been diligently addressed. Furthermore, SK Networks is taking proactive actions to eliminate hazards found from feedback contributed by workers via the health and safety council. Walkerhill has implemented an enterprise risk management (ERM) system to enhance its risk assessment scheme specific to the needs of its worksite.

The council serves as a platform to enhance health and safety protocols and gather feedback from workers regarding health and safety issues at each SK Networks worksite. Quarterly collaborative inspections are conducted to evaluate safety conditions and mitigate potential accidents onsite. Furthermore, risk assessments are also regularly conducted to solicit input from workers and suppliers on health and safety hazards, ensuring ongoing improvement. Walkerhill remains committed to identifying and mitigating health and safety risks, including the enhancement of road infrastructure to promote pedestrian safety.
